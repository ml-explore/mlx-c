# MLX C

MLX C is a C API for [MLX](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx).

MLX is an array framework for machine learning on Apple silicon. MLX C expands
MLX to the C language, making research and experimentation easier on Apple
silicon.

MLX C can be used standalone or as a bridge to bind other languages to
MLX. For example, the [MLX Swift](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift/)
package uses MLX C to provide a Swift API to MLX.

For more information see the [docs](https://ml-explore.github.io/mlx-c).

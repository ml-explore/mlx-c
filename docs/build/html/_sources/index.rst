MLX C
=====

MLX C is a C API for `MLX <https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx>`_.

MLX is an array framework for machine learning research on Apple
silicon. MLX C expands MLX to the C language, making research and
experimentation easier on Apple silicon. MLX is intended for research and
not for production deployment of models in apps.

MLX C can be used standalone or as a bridge to bind other languages
to MLX. For example, the `MLX Swift
<https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift/>`_ package uses MLX C for Swift
bindings to MLX.
